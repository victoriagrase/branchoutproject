# **Review of MurTree: Optimal Decision Trees**

The Murtree Algorithm computes optimal classification trees by
exhaustive search. The search space is exponentially large, but special
measures are taken to efficiently iterate through all trees, exploit the
overlap between trees, and avoid computing suboptimal decision trees.

# **Core Equation**

The following equation is the core foundation of the algorithm. The
dynamic programming formulation of optimal classification trees is given
by Figure 1 where input parameters consist of binary data set ‚ÖÖ with
features ùêπ, an upper bound on depth ‚ÖÜ, and an upper bound on the number
of feature nodes ùëõ. The output is the minimum number of
misclassifications possible on the data given the input decision tree
characteristics. Here ‚àÖ indicated that tree is infeasible or not of
interest since a better tree is known.

# **Algorithm 1**

The main algorithm is summarized using the following pseudocode where
"caching and pruning" strategy is implemented for optimizing subtrees
within a larger tree structure.

-   The algorithm begins by checking for infeasibility where if the
    upper bounds are negative or the classification node
    misclassification exceeds the upper bound, the tree is considered
    infeasible

-   The cache is then queried to see if the optimal tree has been
    computed. If the subtree is in the cache and meets the upper
    boundary constraints, it is returned. Otherwise, infeasibility is
    reported. Furthermore, additionally caching is done based on depth
    and node constraints.

-    The cache is then updated by using a similarity-based lower bound
    if the optimal subtree is not in the cache. Here the new lower bound
    replaces the old cached bound if the value is greater. The optimal
    subtree is returned if found or reported infeasible if if exceed the
    upper bound constraint

-   Pruning is then attempted based on the lower bound stored in the
    cache. If the lower bound matches the misclassification score of a
    classification node, a classification node is returned

-   The algorithm then considers a specialized procedure for subtrees
    with a depth that is less than or equal to 2. If this is the case,
    solutions for one, two, and three feature nodes are stored in the
    cache, regardless of input requirements. After computation, the
    corresponding subtree is returned if it is within the upper bound
    limit otherwise, infeasibility is reported

-   If none of the aforementioned conditions apply, the algorithm
    exhaustively explores the search space through overlapping
    recursions per the equation. This is detailed in Algorithm 2
